## How to get setup (Windows)
 1.  Go and download python [here](https://www.python.org/)
 2. Run the installer and click "Custom installation"
 3. Check the box that says "Add python to your PATH environment variable"
 4. Click next until it installs
 5. Make sure python and pip are commands by running `python --version` and `pip --version`
 6. If you do not have git install [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
 7. run `git clone https://github.com/CruizK/tech-teacher.git` and it should create a folder called "tech-teacher"
 8. run `pip install django` and navigate into `techsite/` folder 
 9. run `python manage.py runserver` and it should then run the server so if  you go to your browser and navigate to `localhost:8000` you should see the webpage

**Note if running python & django on Linux** : Follow [this](https://www.howtoforge.com/tutorial/how-to-install-django-on-ubuntu/)

I Recommend using visual studio code which you can download [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), If you already have a different editor that you use feel free to use it

## Once you are setup please cick techsite/ and then code_editor/ and read through those to understand the project
